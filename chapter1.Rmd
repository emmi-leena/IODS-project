# About the project

"I heard about this course from email that was sent by *doctoral program* coordinator.  I´m hoping to get more familiar with the RStudio and learn how to use state-of-art tools of data sciece to visualise and analyse open data.  Currently I´m a bit exciting about the course and also a bit worried how I will be able to able to follow strict deadlines same time as finalizing my PhD."
