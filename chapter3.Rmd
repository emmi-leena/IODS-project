# Analysis

## Reading of the data

read.csv ("alc.csv")

## structure and dimension of the data:
colnames(alc)
str(alc)
dim(alc)

Data is consisted of two joined datasets where students achievement in secondary education of two Portuguese schools are explained. Two datasets are provided regarding the performance in two distinct subjects. Data consist of 382 objectives and 35 variables.

## Names of variables:
colnames(alc)

## FOllowing variables were compared to high/low alcohol consumption
Sex, failures, goout, absences

## Personal hypothesis behind these chosen variables
Sex: There are more men than women that use alcohol in high consumption
age: Students that have high number of past class failures are using more alcohol
goout: Students that go out with friends have high consumption of alcohol
health: Students that have high alcohol consumption have lower health status

## Numeral exploration of the distributions of chosen variables and their relationship with alcohol consumption

library(ggplot2)
alc %>% group_by(sex, high_use) %>% summarise(count = n())

This data shows that most of the men and womens alcohol consumption is on low level. However, more men are using alcohol high level than women. Therefore my intial hypothesis was partially right.
 
alc %>% group_by(failures, high_use) %>% summarise(count = n()) 

alc %>% group_by(goout, high_use) %>% summarise(count = n())

alc %>% group_by(health, high_use) %>% summarise(count = n())

## Graphical exploration of the distributions of chosen variables and their relationship with alcohol consumption

## Alcohol use vs. sex
g1 <- ggplot(alc, aes(x = sex, y = alc_use))
g1 + geom_boxplot() + ylab("alcohol usage")             
                     
## Alcohol use vs. age

g2 <- ggplot(alc, aes(x = high_use, y = age))
g2 + geom_boxplot()+ ylab("ages")

## Alcohol use vs. goout

g2 <- ggplot(alc, aes(x = high_use, y = goout))
g2 + geom_boxplot()+ ylab("go out")

# Alcohol use vs. health

g2 <- ggplot(alc, aes(x = high_use, y = health))
g2 + geom_boxplot()+ ylab("health")

## Logistic regression

m <- glm(high_use ~ sex + age + goout + health, data = alc, family = "binomial")
summary(m)
coef (m)

## To compute odds ratios (OR):
OR <- coef(m) %>% exp

## To compute confidence intervals (CI):
CI <- confint(m) %>% exp

## TO print out the odds ratios with their confidence intervals
cbind(OR, CI)

## fit the model
m <- glm(high_use ~ failures + absences + sex, data = alc, family = "binomial")

## To predict() the probability of high_use
probabilities <- predict(m, type = "response")
alc <- mutate(alc, probability = probabilities)

## use the probabilities to make a prediction of high_use
alc <- mutate(alc, prediction = probability > 0.5)
select(alc, failures, absences, sex, high_use, probability, prediction) %>% tail(10)
table(high_use = alc$high_use, prediction = alc$prediction)

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
